Randomly came across this what timing, it looks like I screenshotted the install of my first primary VPN server. so insignificant now but back then...
This is a fully functional 2 license private / sovereign VPN self hosted on a private 5 dollar server. Its is being built from ChromeOS and will divide its time between android ChromeOS and Linux without fail. At this time No major proxy service offers VPN service for anything but windows and it is inadvisable. Note that Google states Chromeos can't run it either, though where theres a will. .. It was to be a breakthrough technology that stood to transform current projects for my business at the time but 7 months later my partner doubted the ease with which this could be done. Our loss. This was critical in building everything since. Including integral to a million dollar campaign which also is in the garbage because it was not believed.
