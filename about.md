<h2> Ray 'Antony' not 'Anthony'?</h2>
<p>As for the 'Antony', well the ray anthony account at github is taken I needed a link that would be the same at a glance for something I had (whilst under the assumption rayanthony would be available once I get around to registering it) this didn't work out well. </p>

<p>Also I needed a clean place for current repos for organizational purposes and so teis temporary thing became more permanent. It may or may not last and may or may not turn into a full fledged identity before its demise, too soon to tell.</p>

<P>Have questions? Don't we all! I don't promise answers, in fact probably more questions is likely to result, but do feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:ray@rayantony.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@rayanthonyrcc).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
