  This site is by Ray Antony / Ray Anthony, and any other known aliases that are applicable and none that are not.
</p>

It exists because my real identity among other issues happens to have been dominated in search results by an overzealous employee whose contact info I misplaced, who iwth the best of intentions and not the strongest language skills, did effectively brand me let's say quite aggressively online, burying some ridiculous blog links, mere annoyances from ex customer service disgruntled people, competitors with little class, etc. and now well, I did not like my real last name anyway as it for complicated family reasons is not 'supposed' to be my last name, and it sounds ethnic which is a weird obstacle on the phone in sales and business correspondence. Having been evaluated in tst scores to have the readin gskills equivalent to a '34 year old American male' which I assume is a good thing (thoguh I imagine UK English is superior), I could do without appearing to have the grammar and spelling skills of a 3rd grader, now that I'm 35
ish. That's all I'm saying.

> Ray 'Antony' not 'Anthony'?
As for the 'Antony', well the ray anthony account at github is taken I needed a link that would be the same at a glance for something I had (whilst under the assumption rayanthony woudl be available once I get around to registering it) built links or credentials to an accoun tthat alas the user who set it up and has not used it again in the past 3 years, has so far been unwilling 

Also I needed a clean place for current repos for organizational purposes and so teis temporary thing became more permanent. It may or may not last and may or may not turn into a full fledged identity before its demise, too soon to tell.

Have questions? Don't we all! I don't promise answers, in fact probably more questions is likely to result, but do feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:ray@rayantony.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rayanthonyrcc).

Thanks for reading!
