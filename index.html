        Why Criminality is an unwise Career Path

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

    <h3 id="why-criminality-is-an-unwise-career-path">Why Criminality is an unwise Career Path</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t open up a job interview by submitting to a background check nor choose it for first date conversation. In fact I would prefer to not talk about this sort of thing at all given my experience with criminality is as close to me being an high school as my age is close to 40. And I can promise that for each thing I did do I was charged with 3 something as a kid I was too scared to fight and just rationalized as well think of things I didn’t get caught doing. But it’s as relevant in my daily life as my non existent prom night and brought up in conversation even less. I have struggled to bring a higher level moral character into sales companies that began without any regard to rules. I’ve many times risked it all and been called by someone close to me as “frankenstein” for an apparent over-eagerness to mess with my already perfectly honed model. Well my reason for doing what I did at those times was both an issue of ethical concern as well as strategy for longevity or scalability its actually a lot of hard work to scale and fund a con and not many can pull it off the only ones I know personally that have did it in software instead, downplaying that they are boiler room hustlers of the worst variety some times dealerships I fired because easy money always has a price I’ve done in my own industry more than enough and can’t name a single other person in it’s history that have done a single goddamn thing to be more ethical. I don’t make ethical sacrifices for money generally speaking without much cleverness the two are well known to be diametrically opposed not by necessity but by evidence of history and the nature of humankind and capitalism. PJ O’Rourke said once that capitalism works because it rewards selfishness. And human  beings are inherently selfish. And so the egregious way in which corporations have bent the law to their will and allow their morality to be bent by the dollar is sickening. From GE and their toxic dumping of PCB’s or better  the contamination of wallla walla prison to Enron, and of course the crown jewel of reprehensible the health care industry who has found in the near infinite number of ways capitalism can be used to monetize and leverage a commodity they’ve made a conscious decision to The most basic examples being so things happen in industry that are not good but not any surprise  of practice  I can say first hand   and presenting for funding it matters when a sales engine takes much infrastructure and time to reproduce so reflecting on the lifespan of sales reps that demand any specific in-motion environment in order to train right. So if I’m going to sell a dishonest product, I have to be prepared to hire dishonest people OK with that sort of thing, and then accept the consequences when their dishonesty results in some action that results in them not having the lifespan that a more typical and commonplace employee of a successful organization has. If you cannot sustain your model without constantly fuelling the recruitment engine to cycle through sales reps 4x as fast as clients, that’s fine just don’t think you can call yourself a sales company because you are not. You by this description are more appropriately referred to in relation to what your marketable commodity that which you spend most of your time focusing is, human resources. Your marketable commodity is staffing, and however you do it you are marking up that labor. Just like I wouldn’t call 3 guys in a fraternity room with a team of Indians on odesk doing everything for them students, or when they get older and call themselves a software startup, and well I won’t go there.</p>

<p>I’ve had at least 4 accidents between people hitting my car while its parked in a parking lot and I’m not in it,  An accidental suspension of my license x2, and the same district lost my license plate and was unable to reissue at any DMV for 2 years oh,and I drive sports cars so there are some tickets in there for sure. The ugly is that 20 years ago I spent a few months as a drug dealer. and i got busted. and the circumstance was not normal. The search was beyond illegal, I never said anything but maybe out of fear I would disclose some things I was branded as getting off easy (I didn’t) and certainly I was guilty for double the amount they checked in if you are curious, but I got pulled over 27 or so times in the next year alone. And well not the circumstance you want to give them any ammunition but what can I say I fucked up, a few times. And so it doesnt matter that for every misdeameanor thye write up 3 because when you reall end up at the wrong place but at just the right time, you might just smoking a cigarette listening to zep1 on scoring a ew joint and your friends comes back to the car so quickly after the sound of the smashing  glass you dont even know what happened. you figure it out quick though when he drops his bag and runs through the hills seeing those red and white lights and what more is there to say truthfully I’ve disliked that guy since we were 8 and I saw him eat a booger. Fucking disgusting. And so there went more than I could put into words. I wasn’t even drinking age. The fact that I ran my own sales office for 18 hours a day times 2 years before I was 20 should count for something, but times like this make it not. End of story.</p>

        Customer Service  Social and  Kid Gloves

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

    
<h3 id="cs---blog-background">CS - blog background</h3>
<p>A few years ago a disgruntled former employee was inconsolable upset at my then partner, in his less crooked days (he looked hte same just happier). He wasn’t being treated with the kid gloves that I myself found to be necessary in all dealing with him. These kid gloves, and a lot of empathy and patience allowed me to go so far as to basically fire him, and quite nearly get him to move out of state, far away  (paid by me personally) which is what you want. I acheived this with his word also I would be exempt from the blogs that he would inevitably write because he liked me.</p>

<h3 id="cs---success">CS - success</h3>
<p>Maybe that’s because I don’t fake it when I kid glove, I find a way to make it sincere, maybe its an ability to empathize that I have a gift for. Maybe I don’t have a gift for it I just want to be good at it more than others do. Or maybe, everyone I work with is a goddamn lunatic or sociopath or some such affliction depriving them of emotional intelligence, thus I’m only good because I’m standing next to people particularly awful. I don’t know honestly, I just know I’m not bad it it, thats I think the humble answer.</p>

<p>It fell under my baliwick to design the customer service flow top to bottom in part because I had the patience for it and no doubt because my recovery rate is astounding, and unmatched by anyone in our industry, chargebacks are non-existent because I killed taking credit cards, cancellations and refunds are minimal because I put a stop to lying and misrepping when I officially took the reigns, turned a 1 percent renewal rate into closer to 30% annually, and got our bigest screamers to be calling my cell phone at all hours like they were my best friend. I would on those calls keep my commitments to them large or small which generally was some form of business counseling be it help with SEO, refining their lead process, rewriting their scripts for them if they were sales people and half were considering we were 50% Real Estate customers times a couple million dollars annually per office, and at peak about that in my main office.</p>

        All the small things
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>These small things have culminating in disasters that seem like considerable inconveniences  but more like a retarded me pushing some god forsaken hybrid of SEO and Pay Per Click Managed campaign like a doofus, with the vocabulary of well an Indian Odesker.</p>

<p>I didn’t create those, I fucking tested as having the reading level of a 35 year old in the goddamn 3rd grade. Now I’m over 35, and it looks like I’m a 3rd grader with that brilliant <em>buy SEO and managed pay-per-click from me</em> crap, he knows damn well I hate the very thought of. Get it straight of all the projects I did last year 1 was SEO. 1. It made 80k in 8 weeks and became number 1 out of 700 on every single term by 3 months.</p>

<p>I scrambled to put the whole thing together in 8 weeks with no food and $11 in my pocket on day 1 fresh from getting fucked by chuck, and fast forward a mere two months and it earned $80k+ and was number 1 in its market, and on to make a million. And did it with my girlfriend who hardly knew what SEO was, yes would have been nice to at least been able to use I don’t know the fucking SEO team I owned for 5 years literally only exactly up until the very day where this deal started.</p>

<p>Now thats good luck. Oh and of course I had to plan first that I would be ripped off, because well I wont go into the muslims with a million dollars bit but well I wasnt wrong, lets just leave it at I’m not new to any aspect, of this. Thats the kind of SEO I can do, and I can still say I hate it and its nerdy. I don’t deserve the clowish joke of a campaign to make me a laughing stock interspersed with complaints bureau shit both his sole doing.</p>

<p>It has made me the joke I must be because when I needed helping with the site and many others pathetically small amounts of money I had to just let them go in the garbage while starving. Because he robbed me smeared my name and made me a joke.</p>

<p>I think I like the ridiculous blogs that I’m some mastermind con-artist together with ‘ol chuck. At least it’s less embarrassing. The truth? I already said I’m the guy who was writing the tracking code then and now. The guy who if you look it up you will find the polar opposite of truth, and Charles hand not far from it but a million miles away from the consequences.</p>

    <h3 id="credibility-and-reputation-cheap-lazy-pr">Credibility and Reputation Cheap Lazy PR</h3>

<p>If you aren’t detail oriented you’ll likely not notice how ignoring details and saving money on your PR can be your most expensive mistake, not until its too late. But hey it’s not like the Internet is a permanent record or anything right!</p>

<p>I feel like some old man “now Sonny you only get one name ya hear, don’t you go taking that for granted, I wish I thought more about it when I was your age….” he whistles through his dry lips and dentures. Don’t laugh that old guy is right, and even if you care a lot not, you will still care more later.</p>

<p>A favorite Warren Buffet quote of mine goes :it takes 20 years to build a reputation and only 5 minutes to ruin it.</p>

<p>For me I started caring a whole lot, right about the time other people started looking. Oh also when a hostile takeover turned into an all out war and the current head honcho somehow under the impression we were going after his franchise network, he went ballistic and shot at everybody, shuffled ALL the invoices and randomly sent them to ALL of the offices by fax and email at the same time. Interesting move. I was to get another punishment, like my partner. A dedicated page on his site spewing whatever damaging  thing he could find, and it was going to come with a free domain name too out in florida one sales manager was the lucky owner of dougstewartfelon.com yeah turns out he was a cocaine runner and car thief once, ooh hard to explain.</p>

<p>Me? not much, ok nothing serious. Look I have not been to jail for anything in near 20 years besides a traffic ticket and a Blood alcohol so low, it is literally the legal minimum to even consider charging me. Add a 1 pt margin of error standard allowance on the breathalizer and I’m .0081 the law is 0.008. Look even when I go party, I’m holding myself to rules that night was a late night but hey my partner got his first DUI I think 2-3x that plus LSD and 2 under age hookers driving a two-seater. Naughty, naughty. But full disclosure is on another post. For now lets just say in my youth I made a couple piss poor decisions, and preferred to not have it come out when I’m beginning a new chapter in my career and ascending rapidly, and carefully. So ray***.com would not be welcome.</p>

<p>It was bad enough my partner has an issue, well he was arrested by The Federal Trade Commission. Which come on those guys are such dicks they hate money and private commerce, and they don’t understand it. they almost shouldn’t even deserve to put the cuffs on guilty or not. Make ex-entrepreneurs do it hard up ones who failed have to be narc squad like in the movies, cops shows. Because you should be in the club whether you are there to hang out or to bust the place up you cant come in if you aren’t a member at all.</p>

<p>Anyway I skated here, skin of my teeth. That happens once every 12 years. And in between I take everyone’s heat so no it doesn’t work out but it did this time, because my name said “information forthcoming”. It’s sheer luck he didn’t fill that name field in correctly the luck of a ridiculous spelling of my name.</p>

<p>And I wasn’t his prime target the guys in florid he thought we recruited to team up, they were master reseller we were planning our quiet no enemy no recruiting exit plan by coincidence to his paranoia but it forced our hand and to survive thre was war, a peace accord summit meetings (“meeting of the dons”), the whole bit, and then we were on top and i think only recently he got around to spelling my name right. I was nervous from then on and adopted a phone name, thinking of y girlfriends family, of my family and how I had no right to hurt anyone’s reputation byproxy how it was reckless if I loved them, how I wanted none of that shit as part of my already plentiful obstacles, I was very very serious about it. I know I thought I know how damaging it could be but when you sell an less than above board product as a high risk deal on the spot cash over the barrel only high ticket investment on cold calling for a living you know that the only publicity you don’t control will inevitably be bad publicity and that famous saying on the matter, is horseshit in this world. I though of my aunt in real estate struggling, one or 2 links spilling from me to her index given the rarity of the name was likely and would be devastating. DON’T FUCK AROUND WITH YOUR NAME.</p>

<p>Many success later, many millions a year later here is Charles looking at uneducated offshore slave labor I guess he either wanted to hurt me or just somehow thought was the proper choice to go snatch up all the available social network spellings of my name and reserve them but put the SEO equivalent of a bowel movement, misspelled content, cross our names and paste sloppy graphics around like a down syndrome child no offense, hey lets do it on Crunchbase too in case Zuckerburg didn’t see the Facebook one. Or Marc Andreeson. Yeah remember when we had the first peer to peer HQ DVD encoded video conferencing plugin and the federal government wanted to license it until Johnny went to jail for assaulting his wife? you remember what the dollars were then for funding? That was nothing wait till you see Venturebeat with 20 misspellings in 7 poorly chosen words, that is going to make the money poor in. Dumb Fuck.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

    <h3 id="credibility-and-reputation-bad-blogs">Credibility and Reputation Bad Blogs</h3>
<p>My real name and partially accurate info all misspelled just correct enough though to where it’s undoubtedly me are not just a complication I’ve cut short many of these posts for readability but such as all things in life one thing leads to another and its all cause and effect.</p>

<p>The sum of these small things: a disagreement with a few reps, a big mouth not knowing when to walk away on the blogs, having to have the last word, demeaning people until they of course scream on the internet and throw or make up slime, is  absurdly childish and shortsighted.</p>

<p>You don’t have to look far for evidence of damage, only a couple years before our reseller network when we took over a goddamn industry starting as just a dealer ourselves in a shithole office, would in any other vertical be something books and movies would be about. If not for the bad press, thats warning 1. What happened? 1 customer. 1 customer taken for a very bad deal by one of those resellers, gets so mad he makes a new living for himself bloging us all out of business. and he did, every single office but mine shut down, out of business. And ours lost over 30 maybe 40% of revenue from if I recall about 1.35-1.7 million gross annual at that time. Fucking millions, our people!</p>

<p>You do <em>not</em> engage on public forums how dumb are you? How vain rather. I wonder if we would’ve been so cash strapped living paycheck to paycheck when it all fell over in Irvine might have been gotten through if we had our reseller network intact. Obviously it would’ve helped, I never didn’t know how bad it could be but I lived it and the dollars came out of my pocket. I didnt take from the experiece and challenges in the wake of it that I should go fight ex-employees with a screw loose and a bone to pick on permanent record Internet forums in public view. That just wasn’t the lesson I learned. But I am paying the price for the rest of my life, for the lesson he didn’t learn. For the record you don’t dig into your employees and fight them in any forum, being mean is never necessary and if it ever feels like the right thing to do well I figure that should never factor in for most Americans. When it does its isolated I’ll even accept revenge as that and give you a pass but not if its a godamn pathology you are known for.</p>

<p>Mean-ness, rage, a need to belittle others and feeling nothing or worse, feeling good while doing it is what bullies do. It’s a sickness stemming from as I’ve seen it either overcompensating for feelings of inadequacy and low self worth or from inflated egos and god-like self importance narcissm. They require a doctor, if you aren’t too angry and amped up for a waiting room twice a month. Or you can let it out on your employees so that they are so afraid and angry add to the fact you fired them and they don’t have any other outlet to reach you, you have a recipe for some harsh blogs coming. It may be all customers, and all bullshit, but no matter how many mountains you move to get from one stage to the next, 1 blogger can reset your score. And if you don’t care about that, care about the partner standing next to you because he’s going down with you. Like I did with Charles.</p>

<p>I’ll continue this Credibility Rant with regard to Dangerously Sloppiness Rep Management on a another post</p>
