### Criminality
I've had at least 4 accidents between people hitting my car while itsts parked in a parking lot and I'm not in it,  An accidental suspension of my license x2, and the same district lost my license plate and was unable to reissue at any DMV for 2 years oh,and I drive sports cars so there are some tickets in there for sure. The ugly is that 20 years ago I spent a few months as a drug dealer. and i got busted. and the circumstance was not normal. The search was beyond illegal, I never said anything but maybe out of fear I would disclose some things I was branded as getting off easy (I didn't) and certainly I was guilty for double the amount they checked in if you are curious, but I got pulled over 27 or so times in the next year alone. And well not the circumstance you want to give them any ammunition but what can I say I fucked up, a few times. And so it doesnt matter that for every misdeameanor thye write up 3 because when you reall end up at the wrong place but at just the right time, you might just smoking a cigarette listening to zep1 on scoring a ew joint and your friends comes back to the car so quickly after the sound of the smashing  glass you dont even know what happened. you figure it out quick though when he drops his bag and runs through the hills seeing those red and white lights and what more is there to say truthfully I've disliked that guy since we were 8 and I saw him eat a booger. Fucking disgusting. And so there went more than I could put into words. I wasn't even drinking age. The fact that I ran my own sales office for 18 hours a day times 2 years before I was 20 should count for something, but times like this make it not. End of story.
