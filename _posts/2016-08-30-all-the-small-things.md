These small things have culminating in disasters that seem like considerable inconveniences  but more like a retarded me pushing some god forsaken hybrid of SEO and Pay Per Click Managed campaign like a doofus, with the vocabulary of well an Indian Odesker.

I didn't create those, I fucking tested as having the reading level of a 35 year old in the goddamn 3rd grade. Now I'm over 35, and it looks like I'm a 3rd grader with that brilliant *buy SEO and managed pay-per-click from me* crap, he knows damn well I hate the very thought of. Get it straight of all the projects I did last year 1 was SEO. 1. It made 80k in 8 weeks and became number 1 out of 700 on every single term by 3 months.

I scrambled to put the whole thing together in 8 weeks with no food and $11 in my pocket on day 1 fresh from getting fucked by chuck, and fast forward a mere two months and it earned $80k+ and was number 1 in its market, and on to make a million. And did it with my girlfriend who hardly knew what SEO was, yes would have been nice to at least been able to use I don't know the fucking SEO team I owned for 5 years literally only exactly up until the very day where this deal started.

Now thats good luck. Oh and of course I had to plan first that I would be ripped off, because well I wont go into the muslims with a million dollars bit but well I wasnt wrong, lets just leave it at I'm not new to any aspect, of this. Thats the kind of SEO I can do, and I can still say I hate it and its nerdy. I don't deserve the clowish joke of a campaign to make me a laughing stock interspersed with complaints bureau shit both his sole doing. 

It has made me the joke I must be because when I needed helping with the site and many others pathetically small amounts of money I had to just let them go in the garbage while starving. Because he robbed me smeared my name and made me a joke. 

I think I like the ridiculous blogs that I'm some mastermind con-artist together with 'ol chuck. At least it's less embarrassing. The truth? I already said I'm the guy who was writing the tracking code then and now. The guy who if you look it up you will find the polar opposite of truth, and Charles hand not far from it but a million miles away from the consequences.
