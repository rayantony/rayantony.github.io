### Credibility and Reputation Cheap Lazy PR

If you aren't detail oriented you'll likely not notice how ignoring details and saving money on your PR can be your most expensive mistake, not until its too late. But hey it's not like the Internet is a permanent record or anything right!

I feel like some old man "now Sonny you only get one name ya hear, don't you go taking that for granted, I wish I thought more about it when I was your age...." he whistles through his dry lips and dentures. Don't laugh that old guy is right, and even if you care a lot not, you will still care more later. 

A favorite Warren Buffet quote of mine goes :it takes 20 years to build a reputation and only 5 minutes to ruin it.

For me I started caring a whole lot, right about the time other people started looking. Oh also when a hostile takeover turned into an all out war and the current head honcho somehow under the impression we were going after his franchise network, he went ballistic and shot at everybody, shuffled ALL the invoices and randomly sent them to ALL of the offices by fax and email at the same time. Interesting move. I was to get another punishment, like my partner. A dedicated page on his site spewing whatever damaging  thing he could find, and it was going to come with a free domain name too out in florida one sales manager was the lucky owner of dougstewartfelon.com yeah turns out he was a cocaine runner and car thief once, ooh hard to explain.

 Me? not much, ok nothing serious. Look I have not been to jail for anything in near 20 years besides a traffic ticket and a Blood alcohol so low, it is literally the legal minimum to even consider charging me. Add a 1 pt margin of error standard allowance on the breathalizer and I'm .0081 the law is 0.008. Look even when I go party, I'm holding myself to rules that night was a late night but hey my partner got his first DUI I think 2-3x that plus LSD and 2 under age hookers driving a two-seater. Naughty, naughty. But full disclosure is on another post. For now lets just say in my youth I made a couple piss poor decisions, and preferred to not have it come out when I'm beginning a new chapter in my career and ascending rapidly, and carefully. So ray***.com would not be welcome. 

It was bad enough my partner has an issue, well he was arrested by The Federal Trade Commission. Which come on those guys are such dicks they hate money and private commerce, and they don't understand it. they almost shouldn't even deserve to put the cuffs on guilty or not. Make ex-entrepreneurs do it hard up ones who failed have to be narc squad like in the movies, cops shows. Because you should be in the club whether you are there to hang out or to bust the place up you cant come in if you aren't a member at all. 

Anyway I skated here, skin of my teeth. That happens once every 12 years. And in between I take everyone's heat so no it doesn't work out but it did this time, because my name said "information forthcoming". It's sheer luck he didn't fill that name field in correctly the luck of a ridiculous spelling of my name. 

And I wasn't his prime target the guys in florid he thought we recruited to team up, they were master reseller we were planning our quiet no enemy no recruiting exit plan by coincidence to his paranoia but it forced our hand and to survive thre was war, a peace accord summit meetings ("meeting of the dons"), the whole bit, and then we were on top and i think only recently he got around to spelling my name right. I was nervous from then on and adopted a phone name, thinking of y girlfriends family, of my family and how I had no right to hurt anyone's reputation byproxy how it was reckless if I loved them, how I wanted none of that shit as part of my already plentiful obstacles, I was very very serious about it. I know I thought I know how damaging it could be but when you sell an less than above board product as a high risk deal on the spot cash over the barrel only high ticket investment on cold calling for a living you know that the only publicity you don't control will inevitably be bad publicity and that famous saying on the matter, is horseshit in this world. I though of my aunt in real estate struggling, one or 2 links spilling from me to her index given the rarity of the name was likely and would be devastating. DON'T FUCK AROUND WITH YOUR NAME.



Many success later, many millions a year later here is Charles looking at uneducated offshore slave labor I guess he either wanted to hurt me or just somehow thought was the proper choice to go snatch up all the available social network spellings of my name and reserve them but put the SEO equivalent of a bowel movement, misspelled content, cross our names and paste sloppy graphics around like a down syndrome child no offense, hey lets do it on Crunchbase too in case Zuckerburg didn't see the Facebook one. Or Marc Andreeson. Yeah remember when we had the first peer to peer HQ DVD encoded video conferencing plugin and the federal government wanted to license it until Johnny went to jail for assaulting his wife? you remember what the dollars were then for funding? That was nothing wait till you see Venturebeat with 20 misspellings in 7 poorly chosen words, that is going to make the money poor in. Dumb Fuck.
