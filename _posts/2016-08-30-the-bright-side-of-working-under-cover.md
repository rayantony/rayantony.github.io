Why not RayAnthony?
===

### Why @RayAn*tony* , not @RayAn*thony* or even @*RayKooyenga* ?

[github.com/RayAn*tony*](@rayantony) and [RayAn*tony*.github.io](RayAn*tony*.github.io) exist because my real identity and the proper spelling of my name are not available.  

### My Real Name
I've since acquired and unlocked some other variations so more confusion is available. My proper name is not something I have yet. 

Though as luck would have it legally I own it and logically I should be able to access it and administer it at my discretion with relative ease given that my business owns it. 

### ownership confusion
>So what's the problem?

The problem is that my business partner has taken what was ours and made it his. 

Just try to picture Donald Trump, and his *We're going to grab, and grab, and grab"* speech. Yeah it was kind like that I suppose. Not much ado was made over the innumerable consequences I might face large or small. And well I suppose I would rank this as small, as far as losses as a result of this mess. 

### Inconveniences have a bright side
Public perception, misconceptions, and missed marketing and social opportunities aside it is a huge inconvenience for me more than others and has for complicated reasons prompted workarounds that include even more alternate id's oh yeah then there things like a minor contribution to a DOD/government project which crossed paths with my own federated analytics undertaking at the time and of course the credit is forever linked to this stupid name. 

But because its a *misspelling* of my *alias* name its pretty quiet socially. Enemies cant take shots easily or steal projects, I'm working on I can do so quite secretly in plain view sparing me the necessity I would otherwise have of expensive beyond affordability pro accounts all over town, and that's just the beginning of pain in the ass. 

The things I've put in plain sight and accessible to all is against my nature certainly, but the extent of this is shocking really I imagine, it shocks me to think about but I needed to for sake of balancing time and finance.

When you are robbed blind and under fire with no defenses and have to build a shovel to dig out of the hole you have to face things like sometimes it absolutely will come down to doing the most reckless dangerous things against every bone in your body, rather than devote 20 minutes because the question comes up over sometimes hundreds of times a day. Better yet don't because you don't have time to multiply it out do have the math and make a decision next problem I hate it more than anyone but its been reality, and despite how it all may have looked then and certainly now, I was wrong about pretty much virtually nothing at least I can honestly say for everything that was truly a mistake I knew everytime that it may be so I did not get taken by surprise. Its outside the scope of this piece but I don't make assumptions and wild guesses based on bad information, tainted evidence, I don't ask someone in florida about the weather in california and then take that to a bookie and bet the farm. I can tell you about 3 people though that do that as a matter of course

Most are not significant, and I can still count them on one hand. Thats not arrogance, its a system I adhered to, and to make the claim I just did is the one and only reward the system offers other than that its just about other than the outcome itself and whether it comes with any sort of validation or credit, the reward the only rewardit's arguable none were fatal, half ended absolutely fine anyway-and not because of luck, more like luck wasn't so *bad* that a 7th level backup plan would be needed after all. 

wa for instance  and really is me wanting a kind of perfection bac Real security is a time consuming commitment that once started cannot be easily got around that's sort of the point of it. I need to automate because I have more necessary than I can possibly do, adding more is not an option, cutting is. So that's one good thing.
