Though it is originally and quite obviously we imagine, pertaining to to the jekyll theme and engine, the story is applicable as well to this blog in particular. the 'ray antony' blog project is in fact by rayantony's master 'ray anthony' but through an unfortunate circumstance within the normal naming system eg bad timing, alas it must bear the unfortunate name of 'ray antony', of course missing that crucial consonant the cause of yet a new fracture to the self formerly and to be again, ray anthony.

*Confused?* Yes, aren't we all... But 100's of aliases domains and accounts later, to tell up from down becomes suddenly, not so simple.
