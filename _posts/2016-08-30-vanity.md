I abhor vanity in most forms, and am one of few atheists who find a way to persist in the belief that vanity, laziness, gluttony, self addulation and out of touch or over the top ego, greed, etc are all seriously sinful. It makes no difference to me that I don't believe in God, it's still a sin and I'm uncomfortable around it, one of the first to roll my eyes in fact. I truly dislake whatever sounds like bragging or ego, I am constantly self-conscious to a neurotic degree when it comes to speaking of myself. It's why 99% of what I blog I don't actually publish anywhere, and 99% of what I do I do under aliases or on behalf of other people. If nothing else I figure that since the pearly gates will likely not open for me anyway, I deserve a little something for my humility that I commonly demonstrate not through action but by my lack of actions, my silence in contrast to talking about myself. If everything else was fine, if *anything else* was fine, I wouldn't blog about myself. I don't like it, it's not smart not for who I am. When I blog normally its as someone else for something else, its meaningless its just acting a role I'm good at but don't take seriously because it's just overkill and superfluous. To be me though, if I make myself look weak, my god look what 1 or two sharks did and in a way even unintentionally.
