### Credibility and Reputation Bad Blogs
My real name and partially accurate info all misspelled just correct enough though to where it's undoubtedly me are not just a complication I've cut short many of these posts for readability but such as all things in life one thing leads to another and its all cause and effect. 

The sum of these small things: a disagreement with a few reps, a big mouth not knowing when to walk away on the blogs, having to have the last word, demeaning people until they of course scream on the internet and throw or make up slime, is  absurdly childish and shortsighted. 

You don't have to look far for evidence of damage, only a couple years before our reseller network when we took over a goddamn industry starting as just a dealer ourselves in a shithole office, would in any other vertical be something books and movies would be about. If not for the bad press, thats warning 1. What happened? 1 customer. 1 customer taken for a very bad deal by one of those resellers, gets so mad he makes a new living for himself bloging us all out of business. and he did, every single office but mine shut down, out of business. And ours lost over 30 maybe 40% of revenue from if I recall about 1.35-1.7 million gross annual at that time. Fucking millions, our people! 

You do *not* engage on public forums how dumb are you? How vain rather. I wonder if we would've been so cash strapped living paycheck to paycheck when it all fell over in Irvine might have been gotten through if we had our reseller network intact. Obviously it would've helped, I never didn't know how bad it could be but I lived it and the dollars came out of my pocket. I didnt take from the experiece and challenges in the wake of it that I should go fight ex-employees with a screw loose and a bone to pick on permanent record Internet forums in public view. That just wasn't the lesson I learned. But I am paying the price for the rest of my life, for the lesson he didn't learn. For the record you don't dig into your employees and fight them in any forum, being mean is never necessary and if it ever feels like the right thing to do well I figure that should never factor in for most Americans. When it does its isolated I'll even accept revenge as that and give you a pass but not if its a godamn pathology you are known for.

Mean-ness, rage, a need to belittle others and feeling nothing or worse, feeling good while doing it is what bullies do. It's a sickness stemming from as I've seen it either overcompensating for feelings of inadequacy and low self worth or from inflated egos and god-like self importance narcissm. They require a doctor, if you aren't too angry and amped up for a waiting room twice a month. Or you can let it out on your employees so that they are so afraid and angry add to the fact you fired them and they don't have any other outlet to reach you, you have a recipe for some harsh blogs coming. It may be all customers, and all bullshit, but no matter how many mountains you move to get from one stage to the next, 1 blogger can reset your score. And if you don't care about that, care about the partner standing next to you because he's going down with you. Like I did with Charles.
