<h3 id="video-analytics">Video Analytics</h3>
<p>The one post embezzlement sit down I did have with my partner he couldn’t hide excitement about a 100k funding deal from some hedge fund guy in New York he had access to he was so concerned with the long term he out of character was sitting on it until he was confident he had someone who could pull it off. He is sitting on a video analytics job, the basic specs of which are in production on the same server I’m typing this on because the only server out of a fleet that’s left not turned off for lack of payment is my phone server where I have my production use VBX 100 phone lines for other projects that get routed through here and drafts of my now ruined RTC, SIP, and conferencing software each of which was supposed to be a company anyway. the stats page on a one of my own custom plugins is doubling as a test for detailed user interaction with video elements metrics test version 1 I see it daily. Perfect right I mean I’ve already done it 6 months prior to him telling me I think its safe to call it handled.</p>

<p>Maybe he thought I’d say anything to get back a piece of whats mine, or to not sleep in the car that night as I did the night before on the coldest night of the year, well whatever he thought the fact is Ray <em>Antony</em> (not me of course) has a string of code that put together from place to place certify that he is more than a little familiar with tracking code, I thought my experience with software to track reps go around us, ad metrics for out networks, things going back a decade would give me some points but I guess already done is just not good enough. Funny the same person to sabotage my credibility I guess forgot he did so and is concerned about my credibility. Maybe I explain the Ray Antony ID and take him through some things lol!</p>

<h3 id="why-were-you-building-analytics-software">why were you building analytics software?</h3>
<p>Many reasons I needed to prepare for having to rely on myself and not use Google for security, and at the same time the success of a couple projects was such that my old code stitched together over the decade (yes you heard right I’ve actually wrote tracking software before holy shit!), well it was breaking under the traffic and just not designed for the current demands.</p>
