### [rayantony.github.io](https://rayantony.github.io)
This id and repo set exists to fill a need for a clean place to put current repos, for organizational purposes. And so this temporary thing became more permanent. It may or may not last and may or may not turn into a full fledged identity before its demise, too soon to tell.

Have questions? Don't we all! I don't promise answers, in fact probably more questions is likely to result, but do feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:ray@rayantony.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rayanthonyrcc).

Thanks for reading!
